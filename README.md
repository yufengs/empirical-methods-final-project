# Micro-Theory-Final-Project
All the Julia code and MATLAB code, as well as the log files mentioned in final report can be found here.  
  
The original step 1 and step 2 MATLAB code provided by the authors can be found in the step_01_benchmark and step_02_benchmark folders. In the step_02_benchmark folder, there is also an error log indicating insufficient memory of our personal computer in direct execution of the MATLAB code.  
  
All the server reports (in attempts to directly execute the step 1 MATLAB code provided by the authors) can be found in the Server_Results folder. The output files are truncated as they are larger than the 25 MB size limit for uploaded files. The original output files are available upon request.  
  
The Julia code for replication of step 1 can be found in the Replication folder. The output mat files are too big to be uploaded here. They are also available upon request. The log_benchmark.txt file inside the Replication folder provides the time of executing the Julia code on our personal computer. The MakePi_EndoFrontier_180712_benchmark.mat file inside the Replication folder is the benchmark results of excuting the original MATLAB code provided by the authots for the first 5210 states in the first period in MATLAB, which serves as a benchmark for comparison.  
  
The Julia code and MATLAB code for replication of step 2 with a smaller maximum number of firms allowed can be found in the Replication_simplified folder. The error_simplified file provides the error log of executing the modified MATLAB code in MATLAB. Due to the shrinked state space, the output mat files are smaller enough to be directly uploaded, which can be found in the step_02 subfolder.  
  
The Julia code and MATLAB code for replication of step 2 with a shorter time period can be found in the Replication_simplified2 folder. All of the output mat files, except for the MakePi_EndoFrontier_180712.mat file, are too big to be uploaded here. They are available upon request and one needs all of the mat files from step 1 as the input for executing the step 2 modified MATLAB code.
